This document presents an architecture for experiments in finance. The architecture builds on oTree, a modern platform for behavioral experiments, allowingfor experiments to have sophisticated economic environments, market institutions,and trader strategies. The system supports both continuous as well as discrete-time markets. This architecture allows the experimenter to have a good controlof communication latencies down to one or two hundredths of a second. This, inturn, for instance, facilitates the experimental study of high-frequency trading. Also, the architecture modularizes its main components which makes the systemflexible, portable, and scalable.
